* Magit v3.4.0 Release Notes (unreleased)
** Breaking changes
** Changes since v3.3.0

- Added new function ~git-commit-turn-on-orglink~ intended for use in
  ~git-commit-setup-hook~.

- Some repository and submodule list columns got a bit fancier.

- Refreshing a repository or submodule list buffer now restores the
  previous position.

- Added new face ~git-rebase-action~ to allow customization of the face
  used for the action words in git-rebase-todo files.

- New transient ~magit-sparse-checkout~ provides an interface to the
  ~git sparse-checkout~ command, introduced in Git v2.25.  #4102

- New command ~magit-clone-sparse~ makes it possible to clone a
  repository and then immediately enable a sparse checkout, avoiding a
  checkout of the full working tree.  #4102

- The ~magit-clone~ transient now includes ~--filter~ (hidden by
  default) to support partial cloning, a feature that is available as
  of Git v2.17.  #4102

- A cherry pick or revert can now be continued when there are unstaged
  changes as long as there are no unresolved conflicts, a behavior
  that more closely matches the command line behavior.  #4615

** Fixes since v3.3.0

- Automatic saving of file-visiting buffers was broken inside remote
  repositories that are accessed using Tramp.  #4292

- Worktree commands and listing worktrees in the status buffer were
  broken inside remote repositories that are accessed using Tramp.
  #4326

- Due to a regression in v3.3.0 setting the mark did not highlight the
  current and only selected section until a second section is selected.

- Fixed calculation of gravatar image size.

- The helper function ~magit-current-blame-chunk~ passed the directory
  visited by a Dired buffer to ~git blame~, leading to some commands
  (e.g., ~magit-checkout~) erroring when called from a Dired buffer.
  #4560

- For Helm users, calling ~magit-stash-drop~ on the "Stashes" section
  has been broken since v3.0.0.  #4571

- ~magit-discard~ didn't properly handle conflicts resulting from a
  file being renamed on both sides.  #4225

- Since v3.0.0, ~magit-pull-from-pushremote~ has failed on
  non-fast-forward merges.  #4604

- A regression from v3.2.0 broke visiting a file when that file has a
  mode change and point is on the file or the mode change section.
  #4623
